            <p>In the distant past,<br>
After the chaos of iron and flame subsided, many creatures baked by the Witches scattered across the world.<br>
Among them were the Five.<br>
Five Cookies, graced with Soul Jam of the purest kind.<br>
Wise and powerful, they rallied others to their cause.<br>
As kings and queens, they ruled the Cookies, bringing in a golden age of peace and prosperity.<br>
But this age was not fated to last.<br>
A harbinger of darkness appeared and let shadow and evil infest the land.<br>
And once more, the world erupted into chaos.<br>
But the five Cookie heroes, guardians of peace, have risen.<br>
Twilight falls, and the war for the Cookies' destiny has begun.

                GingerBrave was the first Cookie to escape from the Witch's oven. It is unknown how this Cookie came to life, but rumor has it that the Witch accidentally used magic powder instead of ginger powder.

                Her scent might have worn off if she was as outgoing and active as other Cookies. But no worries, her sweet aroma is just as shy as her and is very reluctant of leaving its core. Her candy coated strawberry fragrance is everlasting, so much so that it transforms regular Jellies into Strawberry Jellies.

                Wizard Cookie came to possess the Witch's Candy Wand by accident (or not?). Within it, he discovered unique magical powers. His popping candy ice cream cone hat is the finishing touch to his wizard look.

                Chili Pepper Cookie's dough contained much more chili pepper than allowed by the law. This is probably why she doesn't care much about rules and such! A notorious treasure hunter, she never misses a chance to snatch everything valuable she can get her hands on.
